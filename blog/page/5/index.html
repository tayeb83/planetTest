Pablo Astigarraga, best known as PoTe, will be <a href="http://2012.eurucamp.org/speakers.html#pablo-astigarraga">a speaker</a> at <a href="http://2012.eurucamp.org/">Eurucamp 2012</a>.</p>




<p><em>This year&#8217;s eurucamp heads out of town to the biggest of Berlin&#8217;s abundant lakes, the Müggelsee. Talks will take place at the Hotel Müggelsee and activities will take place around (and possibly in) the lake.</em></p>




<p>The conference will be held from August 17th to 19th. If you&#8217;re there, go say hi to Pote. His talk will be on Sunday at 12:00:</p>

<h2>Monolithic vs Modular Software: No Holy Grails</h2>




<p>One of the biggest problems in web development today is scalability. It&#8217;s a big problem, and not always easy to solve. The sheer number of requests that large applications need to process is huge, and increasing every day.</p>




<p>One of the most elegant and widely adopted techniques to deal with this is favoring modular architectures over monolithic ones. Having a modular network of tiny apps makes it easier to have a robust, maintainable codebase. Adopting the Unix philosophy of doing one thing right is a topic that has been coming up at conferences and on blog posts all over the world lately, and with good reason.</p>




<p>But is a modular architecture always the best solution? Is then a monolithic approach &#8220;wrong&#8221; from the get go? Sometimes building a modular system is worth it, sometimes it just isn&#8217;t. In this talk I put forward my thoughts and experiences dealing with refactoring your application into several small ones, how to build a monolithic app that can be easily split, how to approach the refactor gradually and incrementally, so as not to lose the ability to deliver new features, and how to decide when it&#8217;s simply not worth it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently had to send an email to our customer (and their developers) regarding mostly git usage and general Ruby coding style on our project.</p>




<p>The list borrows standard concept from many places
and experienced git users and ruby developers will most likely know most of its points, but I was told it would make a good blog post, so here is an adaptation of the email.</p>




<h2>git</h2>




<h3>On Git commit history:</h3>




<ul>
<li>Commit history is important, it&#8217;s even <em>more</em> important when we have a serious problem (IE: need to roll back changes for example). So make sure your commit messages are explanatory of what changes you introduce.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be afraid to use <code>git commit --amend</code> locally, I for example tend to forget about it and commit a lot of &#8216;debugger&#8217; lines. So what I do is delete the lines, <code>git add . &amp;&amp; git commit --amend</code> will fix the commit, so it will never get to github. (Important Note: <em>never</em> ever do &#8211;amend <em>after</em> you have already pushed to github. Or stuff will get scary &#8211; if you do this you&#8217;ll need to force push to github later, and it&#8217;s possible that you delete commits by other people)</li>
<li>Following the same reasoning: the first line of a commit message shouldn&#8217;t be longer than 50 characters. So as to keep it brief and easily parseable when you are reading through the commit history. If you need to  talk more in detail about what you are doing (it happens a lot, and it&#8217;s not bad at all) do <code>git commit</code> <b>without <code>-m</code></b>, so it goes into vim, and then write a short first line, leave an empty line and then describe the commit more in detail.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t mix stuff, if you have a lot of changes do atomic commits only of the relevant files or else it gets really difficult to rollback only one feature, for example. Always think: &#8220;If I had to do a release NOW and this didn&#8217;t work: can I roll it back easily?&#8221;. If the answer is yes then you should be good to go :).</li>
</ul>




<h3>If you are working with Heroku</h3>




<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t ever clone from the heroku repo, clone from the github repo and maintain that as <code>origin</code>, remember that we don&#8217;t use Heroku as version control, so make sure all your latest stuff is on github. There should never be a commit on heroku that was not in github first.</li>
</ul>




<h2>Ruby/General programming:</h2>




<ul>
<li>CSS in the views is a no-no.</li>
<li>Always use two-space indentation (soft tabs), make sure your editor does not insert tabs instead of spaces, as that might look different on different editors.</li>
<li>Same with JavaScript, a little is ok, big stuff goes into its own file (and in coffeescript, if possible).</li>
<li>Trailing spaces: I will murder you in your sleep.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t leave empty lines at the end of a file. It gives me micro-seizures.</li>
<li>Never comment code and leave it there, we have git to remember our stuff, just delete it!</li>
<li>Always indent properly.</li>
</ul>




<p>There is a styleguide for ruby (made by the guys at github) linked below that is more or less consistent with the style we have at <a href="http://cuboxlabs.com">Cubox</a> (and with the standards on the Ruby community in general). Please read it, it&#8217;s only about 5~10 minutes and definitely worth it. :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So for some unknown and weird reason I was contacted last week by someone from recruiting on a company that shall remain nameless,
their intent wasn&#8217;t to hire me (or maybe it was, but they didn&#8217;t say it) but for me to give them advise on how to get in touch with
highly skilled Ruby developers in Europe. They mentioned that I apparently lived there at some point and also misspelled my first name,
which was really annoying.</p>




<p>I was bored today and felt like writing a response with some good advise, not really for their sake, but to try and help a bit
to create a good ecosystem for programmers to work on, what follows is my reply, which I wrote a moment ago. I will just paste it here
in the hope that it might be useful for other Recruiters. And maybe save myself a few emails in the future. :)</p>




<h2>The email</h2>




<p> I&#8217;m sorry I took a long time to answer your email, it was weird receiving it. Allow me to point which parts of it didn&#8217;t make much sense before giving you some advice on how to get in touch with good Ruby developers. :)</p>




<p> I haven&#8217;t really ever been to Europe, ever, and I only very recently spent about two months in the USA, also, you misspelled my first name, which let me tell you is a pretty horrible selling point. You need to take care of that stuff, specially since most good Ruby developers are pretty spoiled from a really favorable (for us) market right now, and used to be treated as highly valuable people are. Be careful about the small details, most of us have at least mild OCD and tend to notice this stuff. It&#8217;s annoying.</p>




<p> On to the advice you need: If you want good developers there are some main things you need to do:</p>




<h3>Make yourself present at conferences.</h3>




<p> We really pay a lot of attention to them, and highly trained developers attend those conferences either as speakers or attendees, try sponsoring  a few for a start, or pay for a drinkup for the conference attendees after the event is done, EuRuKo (the last European conference held in Amsterdam recently) was on <em>every</em> Ruby developer twitter feed, your logo being everywhere and you being nice to people will tell us the two main things we want to know from a company before joining it: you are willing to give back to the open source community and you are fun and relaxed to work with. That&#8217;s <em>really</em> important stuff.</p>




<h3>Pinpoint developers from open source projects an reach  out to them.</h3>




<p>Do your research, find out about good open source code in github,  who maintains it, who originally wrote it, who contributed, don&#8217;t do stupid stuff like trying to get the original creator of Ruby on Rails as a &#8220;Ruby developer&#8221;,  people in the open source world tend to be above average programmers, mainly due to their code being public and peer reviewed by a lot of other developers, we all learn a lot from that experience and grow to be the strong technical people  that you need.</p>




<p> People with passion for what they do that will the extra mile on their own free will, because we feel proud of our code and want our products to succeed, being a programmer is much like being a gardener, or an architect, or some other form of art, only (for me at least) better. Because we spawn things with our minds and hard work and to see our brainchilds succeed is one of the greatest sources of joy we find. You want people with that sort of passion.</p>




<h3>Spoil your developers (maybe not that much, but at least a little)</h3>




<p>For better or worse most good developers today are really spoiled by the companies hiring them, and we&#8217;ve grown used to that, because of that it is <em>highly</em> unlikely that me or any developer that is happy leaves his or her job, and it&#8217;s <em>very likely</em> that a developer who feels mistreated, be it lack of respect for his work, considering him/herself underpaid or whatever other such thing will leave fairly quickly for greener pastures. The market has need of us and we are used to it. It&#8217;s just a fact that companies need to deal with these days.</p>




<h3>Allow remote work</h3>




<p>This is unfortunately just a no-brainer for you, most developers have their lives and the possibility of working remotely. Having a distributed team introduces some difficulty in team management but also gives you a much larger pool of suitable candidates, specially highly skilled developers, they can work for good companies from home, if they can&#8217;t do so for your company they are likely to not be interested.</p>




<p> I think those are the main facts, of course they don&#8217;t particularly apply to European developers, but Asian, South American, you name it. Wish you the best of luck with your company. :)</p>

We are very proud to announce cuboxer Bruno Aguirre (a.k.a. &#8220;cuervo&#8221;) will <a href="http://www.euruko2012.org/speakers.html#bruno-aguirre">one of the speakers</a> at <a href="http://www.euruko2012.org">Euruko 2012</a>:</p>




<blockquote><p>EuRuKo is an annual conference about the Ruby language with an informal atmosphere and lots of opportunities to listen, to talk, to hack and to have fun.</p></blockquote>




<p>The conference will be held on June 1st and 2nd in Amsterdam and tickets are already sold out.</p>




<p><img class="left" src="http://blog.cuboxlabs.com/images/bruno.jpg" title="Bruno &#34;cuervo&#34; Aguirre" alt="Bruno &#34;cuervo&#34; Aguirre">Bruno will be giving the following talk:</p>




<h2>The Future is Dead: Long live the Past</h2>




<p>We keep looking for good ideas to improve our code, to make our systems even more
powerful. But there are a lot of good ol&#8217; ideas that are resurfacing and most
of them were already thought about years ago.</p>




<p>I propose a journey through technology archeology to re-discover all that tools
that are buried deep into the internetz.</p>




<p>Remember the scriptures of ‘The unix way’, the HTTP reference engraved in stone
and learn from the elders about concurrency and single responsibility.</p>




<ul>
<li>Old new HTTP</li>
<li>The Unix way in a modern world</li>
<li>RDBs mystic powers</li>
<li>&#8230; more stuff for free</li>
</ul>




<h3>Why should i care?</h3>




<p><em>We have a lot of COOL new technologies like a Nodejs Fibonacci server and stuff</em></p>




<p>New technologies are great, but they are only a part of all the old ones that
are buried in people&#8217;s mind. I want to show the amazing ideas that were crafted
years ago and are waiting to return.</p>




<p><em>Old things are old and … like… old stuff sucks</em></p>




<p>A lot of old stuff sucks but a lot of it can teach us the way of crafting
optimized code and solid solutions without being monolithic. And remember
satellites and spaceships code were made without EC2.</p>




<p>If you go to Euruko, find Bruno and ask him for a hug.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week we hosted the monthly Ruby Meetup at Cubox. We had a great level of talks and a good pressence of developers.</p>




<p><img class="center" src="http://blog.cuboxlabs.com/images/rubymeetup02/rubymeetup-01.jpg" title="Ruby Meetup" ></p>




<p>First Martin Loy from <a href="http://guruhub.com.uy/">Guruhub</a> gave a talk about scaling Rails. He compared the results at his company using different available Ruby webservers: <a href="http://unicorn.bogomips.org/">Unicorn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matadon/mizuno">Mizuno</a>, Passenger and <a href="http://torquebox.org/">Torquebox</a>. It was his first time working with Ruby and he shared his experiences and results with each server.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://blog.cuboxlabs.com/images/rubymeetup02/rubymeetup-03.jpg" title="Ruby Meetup" ></p>




<p>You can see his presentation <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/cuboxsa.com/presentation/d/1wY-irVmSKVNnapA2d8f3drPxAvS3U52kePbY3pt0gCI/edit?pli=1#slide=id.g30b4d23_0_133">on this link</a>.</p>

<p>Then Federico Wagner from Artech talked about Genexus, a code generation tool, its Ruby generator and how Ruby is used in the company. It was an improvised talk and gave to very interesting discussion.</p>

<p>After the first two talks we had the pizzas, beer and sodas. As always, great discussions and conversations among the developers.</p>

<p>Last but not least, our own foca gave a talk about <a href="https://github.com/ddollar/foreman">foreman</a>, a command line application to manage procfile-based apps.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So a few days ago I manned up and decided to finally write <a href="http://github.com/pote/planet.rb">planet.rb</a>, mainly because I need to have a way of merging several blogs into one in a tidy way.  This evening (while on a furious caffeine high) I thought of a slightly different application for the gem.</p>




<h2>Octopress is awesome, and you should use it.</h2>




<p>In the last few weeks I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> a lot, its a fully customizable blogging engine that just gives you controll of everything. It&#8217;s also powered by the mighty <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, the gem that is also responsible for <a href="http://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>.</p>




<p>The process to set up Octopress is simple, and described perfectly in it&#8217;s <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/">documentation</a>, you basically install a few dependencies, clone the repository, and you are ready to start writing blog posts and deploy your blog to <a href="http://github.com">github</a> or via rsync to a private vps.</p>




<h2>That is kinda neat, but I&#8217;m using { wordpress || blogger || whatever }</h2>




<p>Exactly, and you really shouldn&#8217;t, that&#8217;s where <a href="http://github.com/pote/planet.rb">planet.rb</a> comes into play.</p>




<h2>Import your blog using its RSS/Atom feed</h2>




<p>Once you have followed the <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/">Octopress Docs</a> to the point where you already have a cloned empty blog, simply install planet.rb with <pre> gem install planet </pre> and run the following commands on the Octopress root directory.</p>




<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>▸ planet init
</span><span class='line'>=&gt; Created default planet.yml</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>You will want to open the <strong>planet.yml</strong> file and put only your blog feed (as an example, the feed for this blog is <a href="http://blog.poteland.com/atom.xml">http://blog.poteland.com/atom.xml</a>) and your name as author, you can just put an empty string (&#8221;) for your picture, as we won&#8217;t be using that.</p>




<p>We will also need to empty the author.html template file so that it doesn&#8217;t put up an unnecessary picture of you. Do it with this command</p>




<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>▸ &gt; source/_layouts/author.html</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>▸ planet generate</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>




<p>That&#8217;s it! planet.rb will pick up your blog, process the posts and save them in Octopress&#8217;s source/_posts/ directory. After that continue with the Octopress setup guide, with all your posts already on it. Congratulations on joining the Octopress community! :)</p>
